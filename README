FILES:
multinomDAR.R - an extension to R flexmix package implementing the DAR class 

seqMBC.R - code that demonstrates a core set of models discussed in the paper.  Instructions for adjusting the parameters in the runs are given in that code

oneSimDARcores.txt, oneSimDARprof.txt - raw data files of *simulated* sequences.  Based on models fit for SHP data, but simulated to ensure confidentiality of original source. No identifiers or even individual characteristics were included.  These data are entirely simulated; resemblance to real individuals is only in the aggregate.
